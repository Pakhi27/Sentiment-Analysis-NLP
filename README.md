# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP


# Sentiment Analysis using NLP Techniques

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods on Amazon product reviews to analyze and classify sentiments. It combines rule-based (VADER) and transformer-based (RoBERTa) approaches, along with thorough exploratory data analysis and impactful visualizations.

---

## Project Objective

To perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews using both classical NLP techniques and state-of-the-art deep learning models. The aim is to identify and compare sentiment trends using both approaches and visualize their relationship with review ratings.

##  Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized review count per rating
- Investigated common patterns in review text

### 2. Classical NLP (NLTK + VADER)
- Tokenization, POS Tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Sentiment scoring using VADER (compound score)

### 3. Deep Learning Approach (RoBERTa)
- Used pre-trained `roberta-base` from Hugging Face Transformers
- Encoded review text and classified it as positive, negative, or neutral

### 4. Merging Results
- Combined VADER and RoBERTa outputs for comparison
- Created new columns for each modelâ€™s sentiment score

### 5. Visualizations
- Bar plots for rating distribution
- Pie charts and histograms of sentiment categories
- Pair plots to compare VADER and RoBERTa sentiment scores

---

##  Key Findings

- **VADER** performs well on short, explicit text.
- **RoBERTa** handles complex and nuanced reviews more accurately.
- Positive correlation observed between compound sentiment scores and actual review ratings.
- RoBERTa yields better accuracy and generalization than VADER on textual sentiment classification.

## ðŸ“Š Visual Insights

- **Bar Plot**: Count of reviews by rating
- **Pie Chart**: Sentiment distribution (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- **Scatter Plot**: VADER vs. RoBERTa scores
- **Pair Plot**: Distribution and correlation of sentiment scores
